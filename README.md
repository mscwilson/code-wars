## Code Wars

My solutions for various katas (problems) on [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/).

Each kata has its own folder. I've pasted the Code Wars link and instructions into the README of each.

Baker_pete, palindrome, string_mix and trolls are in Ruby.
Alan_Partridge_apple is in Javascript.
