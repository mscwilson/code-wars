## Code Wars

My solutions for various katas (problems) on [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/).

Each kata has its own folder. I've pasted the Code Wars link and instructions into the README of each.

#### Ruby
The following katas are in Ruby, with Rspec for tests:  
baker_pete  
palindrome  
string_mix  
trolls  

#### JavaScript
The following katas are in Javascript, with Jasmine for tests:  
Alan_Partridge_apple  
meetup_europe  

### Running the code
* Clone this repo
* Navigate to the cloned folder
#### Ruby
Make sure Ruby 3.0.0 and Bundler are installed.
* Find the main file for each kata in the `lib` folder
* Play with the code using the irb REPL: `irb -r ./lib/<filename>`
* To run the tests, `exit` from irb and run: `rspec`

#### JavaScript
JavaScript is installed in browsers already.
* Open `SpecRunner.html` in your browser
* The test results will be shown
* Use the Developer Tools Console REPL to try out the code
